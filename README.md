# Brief about the project : 
Prediction of bengaluru house prices using regression models

# Learning focus: 
to apply multiple regression models in a loop without using hyperparameter tuning on a clean data. The accuracy was not in focus.

# Steps followed:
1. Data collection (Kaggle)
2. Data cleaning
3. EDA
4. Model Building

# Models  on focus:
1. Linear Regression 
2. SVRegression
3. Decision tree regression 
4.Random forest regression
5. Bayesian Regression
6. Lasso Regression
7. Elastic net regression
8. XG boost regression 
9. Gradient boosting regression
10.Bagging regression
11.Adaboost regression

# Areas of improvement : 
sqft area is an important feature and should be cleaned.
