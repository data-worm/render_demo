# Brief about the project : 
Deployment of ML model on render ([Predict IRIS](https://render-demo-2-l68g.onrender.com/))

# Learning focus: 
To push code to Github and then deploy model to a web service by using a simple dataset and  a simple algorithm. 

# Steps followed:
1. Data collection (Kaggle)
2. Data cleaning
3. EDA
4. Model Building
5. Using streamlit for the front end
6. push code to Github
7. Deployment on render

# Areas of improvement : 
1. Making pipelines
2. package version conflict in jupiter notebook & VS code
